# Shadow Cones

![Mammal 2D Visualization](./mammal_vis_wide.png)

This repository contains official implementation of the paper
[Shadow Cones: Unveiling Partial Orders in Hyperbolic Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15215).
Some of our code in data loading part is adopted from [hyperbolic_cones](https://github.com/dalab/hyperbolic_cones).

### Dependencies
Our implementation works with Python>=3.9 and PyTorch>=1.12.1. We use [HTorch](https://github.com/ydtydr/HTorch)
for optimization within hyperbolic space of different models. Please refer to HTorch repo for installation.
To install other dependencies, use: `$ pip install -r requirement.txt`

### Data
We provide the WordNet datasets (mammal and noun) under `data_utils/data/maxn/`, which
are the same as those used in [entailment cone](https://github.com/dalab/hyperbolic_cones/tree/master/data/maxn).
Due to space limit, ConceptNet and hearst datasets are stored on Google Drive. Please download 
with `gdown` and move them to `data_utils/data/MCG` and `data_utils/data/hearst`:
```python
pip install gdown
gdown --no-check-certificate --folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WH2LIk2EsTe_lQ03AjCaxZ3o8fSkNt1f?usp=sharing
```

### Usage
We use `train.py` to train on small datasets (e.g., mammal.) with single process, and `train_hogwild_lazy.py` to
train on large datasets (e.g., noun, MCG and hearst) with multi-processing. We provide commands and
hyper-parameter guideline in `run.sh`, for training different shadow cones on specified datasets.
```python
bash run.sh
```
